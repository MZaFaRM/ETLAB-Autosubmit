I made this to help me automatically fill and submit the the course exit surveys and other surveys  from [etlab](https://kmctce.etlab.app/) that are 
necessitated by my college since I found out that my answers in them were largely predictable - I always choose the first option. 
Learned a bit about BeautifulSoup and Request module of python. Also learned the purpose of `yield` in python. It's apparently quite useful and simple.

# Skills learned

- Web Scraping

# Notes

I learned the hard way (ie: already wrote the code) that free hosting sites usually limit the communication between 
sites, hence, unless I pay for this app. It would never be ported to the 
web - which is likely never.
